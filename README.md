# CPTDN
Induction chemotherapy (ICT) plus concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) and CCRT alone were the optional treatment regimens in locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients. However, previous prognostic models of NPC did not take the treatment factor into account, neglecting the fact that the heterogeneity of therapy could result in their poor performances in clinical practice. We aim to use multi-task deep-learning radiomics to develop simultaneously prognostic and predictive signatures from pretreatment magnetic resonance (MR) images of NPC patients, and to construct a combined prognosis and treatment decision nomogram (CPTDN) for recommending the optimal treatment regimen and predicting the prognosis of NPC. The manuscript of this study has been submitted to the Annals of Oncology, titled “A multi-task deep learning-based radiomic nomogram for prognosis and treatment decision in nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients with stage T3N1M0”.
